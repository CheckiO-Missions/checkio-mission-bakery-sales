<p style="text-align: justify;">
    A bakery sells wholemeal breads, sweets and cakes. To encourage sales, the director announced prizes based on the number of products sold during the week, following a point system: each loaf of bread (<code>b</code>) is worth 1 point, each sweets pack (<code>s</code>) is worth 2 points and each cake (<code>c</code>) is worth 3 points. Depending on the total points accumulated, employees may receive a different reward. The challenge is to create a program that determines which award employees will receive based on the quantity of each product sold.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    If the sum of the points of all products sold in the week is equal to or greater than 150, each employee receives a cake (<code>"C"</code>) as a prize; otherwise, if the sum of the points is greater than or equal to 120, each employee receives a sweets pack (<code>"S"</code>) as a prize; otherwise, if the sum of the points is greater than or equal to 100, each employee receives a loaf of bread (<code>"B"</code>) as a prize. If the sum of the points is less than 100, there is no award (<code>"N"</code>) for the employees.
